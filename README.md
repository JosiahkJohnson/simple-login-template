## Description:<a name = "Description"></a>
A simple boilerplate application that allows users to register to an application. It stores their name, email, and password by default. The password is hashed in the database using bcrypt, so even with a database leak it should be secure.

## Installation Requirements:<a name = "Installation"></a>
More instructions to be added later once the module is ready to be used in real applications. Mostly just used as a default template landing page.

## Usage:<a name = "Usage"></a>
As a user, simply register as a user like with most web applications. As a developer, most of the legwork is done in this app, you just need to set the redirects to your landing page, or login page, and adjust a few things in the config file in regards to the Sequelize library.
